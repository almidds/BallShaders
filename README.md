# BallShaders

A project to learn more about compute shaders. This code will be based off of the [Three Eyed Games blog post](http://blog.three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/03/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1/) about GPU ray tracing.

Here's the result I obtained after completing the second chapter of the blog posts. This was a successful project and has got me feeling a lot more comfortable with how to write compute shaders for Unity.
